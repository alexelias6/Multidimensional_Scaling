## Introduction to (Classical) Multidimensional Scaling
Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a dimension reduction technique that is most useful for visualizing 
high-dimensional data during the exploratory phase. MDS "represents measurements of similarity 
(or dissimilarity) among pairs of objects as distances between points" \[1]. Simply put, objects closer
together (in terms of MDS coordinates) are more similar than objects farther apart. There are two types
of MDS: metric, which deals with quantitative dissimilarities, and non-metric, which deals with qualitative
(ordinal) dissimilarities. Within metric MDS, classical MDS involves minimizing a loss function called 
Strain, which is equivalent to performing eigenvalue decomposition on a Gram matrix constructed
from the dissimilarity measure. When the dissimilarity measure is Euclidean distance, classical MDS is 
the same as Principal Components Analysis. However, the dissimilarity measure need not be Euclidean 
distance, as we demonstrate below. Indeed, other dissimilarity measures may do a better job of 
approximating the original data. 

In this tutorial, we will use two R functions, `torgerson` from the `smacof` package and `cmdscale` from 
the `stats` package (which is available in base R), plus the `mds` command from Stata, to perform 
classical MDS.

## Data Description

The data used in the following examples come from the Cars93 dataset available in R's `MASS` package. The observations of
the dataset are 93 randomly selected 1993 passenger car models listed in the Consumer Reports issue and PACE Buying Guide.
Information contained in the dataset includes various automobile metrics such as price, horsepower, and luggage 
capacity. For raw data click [here.](http://jse.amstat.org/datasets/93cars.dat.txt?fbclid=IwAR19EJDNQzMMQOBe6ZC4t4li0zx0UpkDBAoSWDNWa3T54JXc-yfpPiPIqsk)

Our three examples will involve briefly cleaning the data, calculating dissimilarities among our chosen variables in four 
different ways, performing classical MDS, and plotting the resulting coordinates in two-dimensional space. 
The four measures of dissimilarity we will be using are Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Maximum distance, 
and a dissimilarity measure based on the correlation matrix. Euclidean distance between the attributes of objects $i$ and $j$ is calculated as: 
\[
\sqrt{(x_{i1} - x_{j1})^2 + (x_{i2} - x_{j2})^2 + \cdots + (x_{ik} - x_{jk})^2}
\]

Manhattan distance between the attributes of objects $i$ and $j$ is calculated as: 
\[
|x_{i1} - x_{j1}| + |x_{i2} - x_{j2}| + \cdots + |x_{ik} - x_{jk}|
\]

Maximum distance between the attributes of objects $i$ and $j$ is calculated as: 
\[
\max(|x_{i1} - x_{j1}|, |x_{i2} - x_{j2}|,\ldots,|x_{ik} - x_{jk}|)
\]

The correlation-based measure of dissimilarity used by Stata (and implemented by us in R) for a matrix $X$ is calculated as: 
\[
\sqrt{2\cdot(1-corr(X))}
\]

The variables we will be using for MDS are presented in the table below.

```{r variables, include = FALSE }

library(knitr)
variables = read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexelias6/Multidimensional_Scaling/master/mds_variables.csv')
```

```{r table, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(variables)
```

## Implementation {.tabset .tabset-fade}

### R (`smacof` & `data.table`)
In this section we will use R packages `smacof` and `data.table` to perform MDS on the Cars93 dataset. The `smacof` package is used to implement various approaches for multidimensional scaling while `data.table` is used for data manipulation. First, we load the appropriate libraries. 
```{r, message=FALSE}
# Libraries 
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(smacof)
```
The dataset for this example is stored in the `MASS` package. The following code loads the data in as class data.table which allows for data manipulation using the `data.table` package.
```{r}
# Get data
Cars93 = as.data.table(MASS::Cars93)
```
The only variables with missing values are Rear.seat.room and Luggage.room. We drop the observations containing these
missing values.
```{r}
Cars93 = Cars93[!is.na(Rear.seat.room) & !is.na(Luggage.room)]
```
Next, we select our variables and standardize them using the `scale` function to give all variables equal weighting.
```{r}
Cars93_cont_scaled = Cars93[,.(Min.Price, Price, Max.Price,
                               MPG.city, MPG.highway, EngineSize,
                               Horsepower, RPM, Rev.per.mile,
                               Length, Wheelbase, Width,
                               Turn.circle, Rear.seat.room,
                               Luggage.room)] %>%
                      scale()
```
Then we create different types of dissimilarity matrices using the code below. Any of these dissimilarity measures
can be used for MDS. 
```{r}
for (method in c('euclidean', 'manhattan', 'maximum')) {
  assign(paste("distance", method, sep='_'), dist(Cars93_cont_scaled, method = method))
}

distance_correlation = sqrt(2*(1-cor(t(Cars93_cont_scaled))))
```
Lastly, we perform MDS using the `torgerson` function from the `smacof` package. This function takes the dissimilarity 
matrix as its argument and performs classical MDS. It is worth noting that `torgeson` has an optional argument, 
p, which is used to specify the dimensionality of the resulting coordinates. We chose the default of 2 dimensions because 
it is easiest to visualize. However, using more dimensions can better approximate the original data. The code below performs 
MDS using Euclidian distance and then plots the resulting coordinates.
```{r}
# Euclidean Distance
torgerson_euclidean = torgerson(distance_euclidean)
df_euclidean = data.frame(
  Z1=torgerson_euclidean[,1], Z2=torgerson_euclidean[,2],
  Model=Cars93$Model)
ggplot(df_euclidean, aes(x=Z1,y=Z2),main='Main') + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label=Model), hjust=-0.2, size=3)
```

The code below performs MDS using Manhattan distance and then plots the resulting coordinates.
```{r}
# Manhattan Distance
torgerson_manhattan = torgerson(distance_manhattan)
df_manhattan = data.frame(
  Z1=torgerson_manhattan[,1], Z2=torgerson_manhattan[,2],
  Model=Cars93$Model)
ggplot(df_manhattan, aes(x=Z1,y=Z2),main='Main') + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label=Model), hjust=-0.2, size=3)
```

The code below performs MDS using Maximum distance and then plots the resulting coordinates.
```{r}
# Maximum Distance 
torgerson_maximum = torgerson(distance_maximum)
df_maximum = data.frame(
  Z1=torgerson_maximum[,1], Z2=torgerson_maximum[,2],
  Model=Cars93$Model)
ggplot(df_maximum, aes(x=Z1,y=Z2),main='Main') + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label=Model), hjust=-0.2, size=3)
```

The code below performs MDS using the correlation-based dissimilarity measure and then plots the resulting coordinates.
```{r}
# Correlation
torgerson_correlation = torgerson(distance_correlation)
df_correlation = data.frame(
  Z1=torgerson_correlation[,1], Z2=torgerson_correlation[,2],
  Model=Cars93$Model)
ggplot(df_correlation, aes(x=Z1,y=Z2),main='Main') + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label=Model), hjust=-0.2, size=3)
```


### R (`stats` & `dplyr`)
In this section we will use R packages `stats` (included in base R) and `dplyr` to perform MDS on the Cars93 dataset. The `stats` package is used to implement various approaches for multidimensional scaling while `dplyr` is used for data manipulation. First, we load the appropriate libraries. 
```{r}
# Libraries
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```
The dataset for this example is stored in the `MASS` package. The following code loads the data in as class tibble which allows for data manipulation using the `dplyr` package.
``` {r}
# Get data
cars93 = 
  as_tibble(Cars93)
```
The only variables with missing values are Rear.seat.room and Luggage.room. We drop the observations containing these
missing values.
```{r}
# Clean data
cars93 = filter(cars93,!is.na(Rear.seat.room) & !is.na(Luggage.room))
```
Next, we select our variables and standardize them using the `scale` function to give all variables equal weighting.
```{r}
cars93_scaled = 
  cars93 %>%
  select(Min.Price, Price, Max.Price,
         MPG.city, MPG.highway, EngineSize,
         Horsepower, RPM, Rev.per.mile,
         Length, Wheelbase, Width,
         Turn.circle, Rear.seat.room,
         Luggage.room) %>%
  scale() %>%
  as_tibble()
```
Then we create different types of dissimilarity matrices using the code below. Any of these dissimilarity measures
can be used for MDS. 
```{r}
for (method in c('euclidean', 'manhattan', 'maximum')) {
  assign(paste("distance", method, sep='_'), dist(cars93_scaled, method = method))
}
distance_correlation = sqrt(2*(1-cor(t(cars93_scaled))))
```
Lastly, we perform MDS using the `cmdscale` function from the `stats` package. This function takes the dissimilarity 
matrix as its argument and performs classical MDS. It is worth noting that `cmdscale` has an optional argument, 
k, which is used to specify the dimensionality of the resulting coordinates. We chose the default of 2 dimensions because 
it is easiest to visualize. However, using more dimensions can better approximate the original data. The code below performs 
MDS using Euclidian distance and then plots the resulting coordinates.
```{r}
# Euclidean Distance
euclidean = cmdscale(distance_euclidean, k=2) 
euclidean_df = data_frame(
  Z1=euclidean[,1], Z2=euclidean[,2],
  Model=Cars93$Model)
ggplot(euclidean_df, aes(x=Z1,y=Z2), main='Main') + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label=Model), hjust=-0.2, size=3)
```
The code below performs MDS using Manhattan distance and then plots the resulting coordinates.
```{r}
# Manhattan Distance
manhattan = cmdscale(distance_manhattan, k=2)
manhattan_df = data.frame(
  Z1=manhattan[,1], Z2=manhattan[,2],
  Model=Cars93$Model)
ggplot(manhattan_df, aes(x=Z1,y=Z2),main='Main') + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label=Model), hjust=-0.2, size=3)
```
The code below performs MDS using Maximum distance and then plots the resulting coordinates.
```{r}
# Maximum Distance 
maximum = cmdscale(distance_maximum, k=2)
maximum_df = data.frame(
  Z1=maximum[,1], Z2=maximum[,2],
  Model=Cars93$Model)
ggplot(maximum_df, aes(x=Z1,y=Z2),main='Main') + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label=Model), hjust=-0.2, size=3)
```
The code below performs MDS using the correlation-based dissimilarity measure and then plots the resulting coordinates.
```{r}
# Correlation
correlation = cmdscale(distance_correlation, k=2)
correlation_df = data.frame(
  Z1=correlation[,1], Z2=correlation[,2],
  Model=Cars93$Model)
ggplot(correlation_df, aes(x=Z1,y=Z2),main='Main') + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label=Model), hjust=-0.2, size=3)
```

### Stata (`mds`)
In this section we will use the Stata command `mds` to perform MDS on the Cars93 dataset. First, we import a CSV
version of the data.
```
//Import data 
import delim using "Cars93.csv", varnames(1) clear
```
The only variables with missing values are rearseatroom and luggageroom. We drop the observations containing these
missing values. Because the missing values were encoded as "NA" strings, these two variables were imported as
string variables, and we have to destring these variables to make them numeric before continuing onto our analysis.
```
//Drop observations with missing values in rearseatroom or luggageroom
drop if rearseatroom == "NA" | luggageroom == "NA"
destring rearseatroom luggageroom, replace
```
This step is not necessary, but to save ourselves from having to use the lengthy list of variables twice
in the upcoming `mds` step, we store our variables of interest in a macro. Remember that Stata macros only
exist temporarily, so you would not want run this code separately from the remaining code.
```
//Macro of continuous variables
local varlist minprice price maxprice mpgcity mpghighway enginesize /*
	*/ horsepower rpm revpermile fueltankcapacity length wheelbase width /*
	*/ turncircle rearseatroom luggageroom weight
```
Lastly, we perform MDS using the `mds` command. This command uses our list of variables plus some very important
options. The 'id' option is used to identify unique observations and label them when plotted. The 'std' option
standardizes the variables so that they are all given equal weight. We also rely on the default value of 'classical'
for the 'method' option to ensure classical MDS is performed. Alternatively we could have specified 'strain' for
the 'loss' option and 'identity' for the 'transform' option to perform classical MDS. Finally, you will see us
use the 'measure' option to specify the dissimarlity measure (the default is Euclidean). It is also worth noting 
that `mds` has an additional option, dimension, which is used to specify the dimensionality of the resulting coordinates. 
We chose the default of 2 dimensions because it is easiest to visualize. However, using more dimensions can better
approximate the original data. The code below performs MDS using Euclidian distance and then plots the resulting coordinates.
```
//MDS: Euclidean distances
mds `varlist', id(model) std(`varlist') noplot
mdsconfig, autoaspect ynegate msize(vsmall) mlabsize(vsmall)
```

![Euclidean](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexelias6/Multidimensional_Scaling/master/stata_euclidean_MDS.png)

The code below performs MDS using Manhattan distance (as the 'measure' option is specificed as 'manhattan') 
and then plots the resulting coordinates.
```
//MDS: Manhattan distances
mds `varlist', id(model) std(`varlist') measure(manhattan) noplot
mdsconfig, autoaspect ynegate msize(vsmall) mlabsize(vsmall)
```

![Manhattan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexelias6/Multidimensional_Scaling/master/stata_manhattan_MDS.png)

The code below performs MDS using Maximum distance (as the 'measure' option is specified as 'maximum')
and then plots the resulting coordinates.
```
//MDS: Maximum distances
mds `varlist', id(model) std(`varlist') measure(maximum) noplot
mdsconfig, autoaspect xnegate ynegate msize(vsmall) mlabsize(vsmall)
```

![Maximum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexelias6/Multidimensional_Scaling/master/stata_maximum_MDS.png)

The code below performs MDS using the correlation-based dissimilarity measure (as the 'measure' option
is specified as 'correlation') and then plots the resulting coordinates.
```
//MDS: Correlation
mds `varlist', id(model) std(`varlist') measure(correlation) noplot
mdsconfig, autoaspect ynegate msize(vsmall) mlabsize(vsmall)
```

## Conclusion
MDS is a convenient way to learn about data. Using this technique, we were able to condense the information provided by
15 different variables into a simple two-dimensional plot. One can look at this plot and immediately draw conclusions.
For example, the [Cadillac Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Seville#Fourth_generation_(1992%E2%80%931997)) 
is consistently plotted close to the [Infiniti Q45](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiniti_Q45#First_generation_G50),
suggesting that the two models were very similar. Indeed, both were 5-passenger luxury midsize sedans with 8-cylinder engines 
and even looked quite alike. Another way to use MDS is to look for clusters that can have important implications for
additional analyses. In our data there are no clusters that really jump out, but we could do further exploration of
the limited separation we see by coloring the points according to the categorical variables available in the data.
Finally, we want to emphasize that one is not restricted to two-dimensional classical MDS. All three packages
we used for our examples are capable of expanding the dimensionality of the MDS coordinates, and two of the packages,
R's `smacof` and Stata's `mds`, can perform a different type of metric MDS called "distance MDS," or, in Stata,
"modern MDS." This involves minimizing a loss function called Stress instead of Strain.
