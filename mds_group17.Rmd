#Introduction to Multidimensional Scaling

Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a useful visualization technique that displays information given in a distance matrix.
“In general, the goal of the analysis is to detect meaningful underlying dimensions that allow the researcher to explain 
observed similarities or dissimilarities” (quote). Simply put, objects that have small distances on the graph are more similar 
than objects that have longer distances. There are two approaches to MDS: metric and nonmetric and this tutorial focuses on 
metric MDS. 

#Data Description

The data used in the following example comes from the Cars93 dataset available in the R's MASS package. The observations of
the dataset are 93 randomly selected 1993 passenger car models listed in the Consumer Reports issue and PACE Buying Guide.
Additional information contained in the dataset includes various automobile metrics such as price, horsepower, and luggage 
capacity. For raw data click [here.](http://jse.amstat.org/datasets/93cars.dat.txt?fbclid=IwAR19EJDNQzMMQOBe6ZC4t4li0zx0UpkDBAoSWDNWa3T54JXc-yfpPiPIqsk)
